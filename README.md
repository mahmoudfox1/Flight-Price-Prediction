✈️ Flight Price Prediction
This project is designed to analyze flight market data, uncover hidden patterns, and gain deeper insights into pricing dynamics. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to accurately predict flight ticket prices. These predictions can help:

Travelers make smarter booking decisions by identifying the best time and price to purchase tickets.

Airlines optimize their pricing strategies and improve revenue management based on data-driven insights.


📌 Project Overview
Problem: Flight ticket prices vary significantly based on multiple factors, making it difficult for users to plan trips and for airlines to optimize pricing.
Solution: A machine learning model trained on real flight data to predict ticket prices, deployed through a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.

Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Streamlit for deployment


🖥️ Installation & Setup
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Recommended to use a virtual environment.
